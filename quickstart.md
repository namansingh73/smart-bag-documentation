**Smart Bag Creator Challenge for Flipkart Grocery**

```
Forgot to order fresh coriander or your favorite box of strawberries or tomatoes while placing
your weekly grocery order online? Wondering that you’ll need to place another small order for
the items missed? Well, that’s something all of us have faced while ordering online, and that’s
what this challenge attempts to solve! In this challenge, teams are required to create a smart
bag that, based on past order history, can predict future orders and create a smart order basket
for the customer - selecting the items required in advance and enabling a faster buying
experience.
```

To tackle this problem, our team, Chemistry Gods went on to make a demo online grocery store that would help us to visualize the Grocery remmondations based on previous orders of the User and their browser history
