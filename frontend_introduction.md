# Frontend

## Introduction

The Frontend is developed in **PUG, SCSS, Javascript** and it's corresponding server in based on **NodeJs** (for backend javascript used for connecting Flask backend), **Express** (for routing) and **MongoDB database** (for storing user information as well as content in the cart),using libraries like **Express, Axios, Mongoose** etc.
There are two main files being used:

1. **app.js** - This is the primary file which acts as the entry point in the application and contains all routing information as well as security modules and other modules being used in the application.
2. **server.js**- This is the server which imports **app.js** to provide all functionalities and provides database connection as well as the port to run the application.

There are many controllers and api end points for various functionalities which would be discussed in detail in the upcoming section.
