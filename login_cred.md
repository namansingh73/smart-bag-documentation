# How to access Smart Gross web app

When you open the link to [Smart Gross](https://smart-gross.herokuapp.com/) app, you will be required to enter e-mail and password.
Here are the credentials for you to login and check if our recommendation system works or not

> For email ID -> tester1@gmail.com<br>There are 7 tester IDs and their respective e-mail IDs can be used by changing the suffix of tester. For example, tester1 -> tester1@gmail.com upto tester7 -> tester7@gmail.com

> For password -> abcd1234 <br>This password works for all tester e-mail IDs

_The initial loading time maybe long due to the free hosting limitations of Heroku. This has nothing to do with our entire system_
