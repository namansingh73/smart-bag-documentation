# Frontend

## Templating Engine

1. We have used **PUG** as our front end templating engine which allows us to render dynamic assests unlike raw **HTML**.

   > **Location** : `./pugtemp`
   > We installed the module **pug** as npm package
   >
   > This folder contains all the **Pug** files that are being used in the project

2. We have used **SCSS** for styling the webpages (SCSS provides many functions as compared to CSS).

   > **Location** : `./src/scss`
   >
   > This folder contains all the **scss** files and a **main.scss** file which imports all other scss files.

3. We have used **JavaScript** for giving dynamic behavior to the web pages.

   > **Location** : `./src/js`
   >
   > This folder contains all the **javascript** files and a **index.js** file which imports all other javascript files.
